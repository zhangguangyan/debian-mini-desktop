Aspect	Observability	OpenTelemetry
Definition and Goal	The capability to infer the internal state of a system based on its outputs (metrics, logs, traces). The goal is to understand, monitor, and improve performance and reliability.	An open-source observability framework providing standardized APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation for collecting telemetry data. The goal is to offer a unified approach to collecting and exporting metrics, logs, and traces.
Components	- Metrics: Quantitative performance data (e.g., CPU usage, request latency). <br>- Logs: Detailed records of events within the system. <br>- Traces: Records of request paths through the system.	- API and SDK: Standardized interfaces for instrumenting applications. <br>- Collector: Standalone agent for receiving, processing, and exporting telemetry data. <br>- Instrumentation Libraries: Pre-built libraries for various languages and frameworks.
Benefits	- Enables proactive monitoring and troubleshooting. <br>- Provides deep insights into system behavior. <br>- Enhances performance optimization and capacity planning.	- Standardizes telemetry data collection across environments. <br>- Reduces integration complexity with multiple observability tools. <br>- Enhances interoperability and data consistency.
Complementary Roles	Overarching practice of understanding and monitoring systems.	Provides the tools and standards necessary for achieving observability.
Data Collection and Standardization	Uses metrics, logs, and traces to infer system state.	Standardizes the collection of metrics, logs, and traces, ensuring consistency and interoperability.
Enhanced Insights and Troubleshooting	Visualizes, analyzes, and alerts on telemetry data for deeper insights and faster issue identification.	Feeds telemetry data into observability platforms, enhancing insights and troubleshooting capabilities.
Flexibility and Extensibility	Supports evolving observability practices and tools.	Modular architecture allows integration with various observability backends, providing flexibility.
Conclusion	Defines the practice and objectives of understanding and monitoring systems.	Provides standardized tools and methods to achieve observability objectives, forming a comprehensive approach together.
