Chart: Stacked area chart showing the rate of requests grouped by HTTP status code.
Purpose: To track the distribution of response codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500) over time.
7. Error Rate
Metric: rate(http_server_duration_milliseconds_count{http_status_code=~"4..|5.."}[5m])
Chart: Line chart showing the rate of error responses (4xx and 5xx status codes).
Purpose: To monitor the error rate and detect issues in real-time.
8. Cumulative Request Duration
Metric: increase(http_server_duration_milliseconds_sum[1h])
Chart: Bar chart showing the cumulative duration of all requests processed per hour.
Purpose: To understand how much time is being spent processing requests over time.
9. Request Rate vs. Latency
Metric:
X-axis: rate(http_server_duration_milliseconds_count[5m])
Y-axis: rate(http_server_duration_milliseconds_sum[5m]) / rate(http_server_duration_milliseconds_count[5m])
Chart: Scatter plot showing the relationship between request rate and average latency.
Purpose: To analyze how increased traffic affects response times.
10. Latency Breakdown by Path or Method
Metric: sum(rate(http_server_duration_milliseconds_bucket[5m])) by (path)
Chart: Stacked bar chart showing the latency distribution for different API paths or methods.
Purpose: To identify which endpoints are contributing most to latency.
Summary:
These charts help in monitoring server performance, understanding traffic patterns, detecting issues, and ensuring that your service is operating efficiently. They provide a comprehensive view of how your server handles requests and how various factors (like traffic spikes or specific endpoints) affect performance.



  Given the metrics http_server_duration_milliseconds_bucket, http_server_duration_milliseconds_sum, and http_server_duration_milliseconds_count, you can create a variety of charts to gain insights into your HTTP server's performance. Here are the top 10 common charts you might consider:

3. Request Duration Percentiles (e.g., 50th, 90th, 95th, 99th)
Query:
promql
Copy code
histogram_quantile(0.95, sum(rate(http_server_duration_milliseconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))
Description: Shows the 95th percentile of request durations over the last 5 minutes.
Purpose: To understand the distribution of response times and identify performance outliers.
4. Histogram of Request Durations
Query:
promql
Copy code
sum(rate(http_server_duration_milliseconds_bucket[5m])) by (le)
