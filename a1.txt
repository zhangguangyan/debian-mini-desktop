Hi [Manager’s Name],

I wanted to take a moment to express my appreciation for [Name]’s help during the recent Specmatic onboarding process.

His responsiveness, attention to detail, and technical expertise — especially in helping us configure the contract tests and troubleshoot CI integration — made a real difference and greatly contributed to the successful onboarding of Specmatic.

It was a pleasure working with [Name], and his contribution added significant value to the onboarding effort.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
