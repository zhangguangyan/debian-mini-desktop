Step 1: Define the Objectives
Understand what insights you want to gain from the HTTP client metrics:

Monitor the performance of outbound HTTP requests.
Identify latency issues and trends over time.
Observe the distribution of request durations.
Detect any unusual spikes or patterns in HTTP request durations.
Step 2: Identify Key Metrics and KPIs
From the provided metrics, we can derive the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

Total Number of Requests: Derived from http_client_duration_milliseconds_count.
Total Duration of Requests: Derived from http_client_duration_milliseconds_sum.
Average Request Duration: Calculated by dividing http_client_duration_milliseconds_sum by http_client_duration_milliseconds_count.
Request Duration Distribution: Using the http_client_duration_milliseconds_bucket to understand how many requests fall into specific latency buckets.
99th Percentile Duration: Calculated from the histogram to understand the high-end latency.
Step 3: Create Visualizations
Total Number of Requests

Type: Single Stat or Line Graph
Description: Shows the total number of HTTP client requests over time.
Query: sum(http_client_duration_milliseconds_count)
Total Duration of Requests

Type: Single Stat or Line Graph
Description: Displays the cumulative duration of all HTTP client requests over time.
Query: sum(http_client_duration_milliseconds_sum)
Average Request Duration

Type: Gauge or Line Graph
Description: Shows the average duration of HTTP client requests over time.
Query: sum(http_client_duration_milliseconds_sum) / sum(http_client_duration_milliseconds_count)
Request Duration Distribution

Type: Heatmap or Bar Chart
Description: Visualizes the distribution of request durations across different latency buckets.
Query:
promql
Copy code
http_client_duration_milliseconds_bucket
Details: Each bucket (le) will show the count of requests that took less than or equal to the specified time.
99th Percentile Duration

Type: Line Graph
Description: Displays the 99th percentile of request durations to highlight tail latency.
Query:
promql
Copy code
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(http_client_duration_milliseconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))
Step 4: Implement the Dashboard
Using a dashboard tool like Grafana, we can create the above visualizations.

Example Grafana Dashboard Setup:
Panel: Total Number of Requests

Title: "Total HTTP Client Requests"
Visualization: Single Stat or Line Graph
PromQL: sum(http_client_duration_milliseconds_count)
Panel: Total Duration of Requests

Title: "Total Duration of HTTP Client Requests"
Visualization: Single Stat or Line Graph
PromQL: sum(http_client_duration_milliseconds_sum)
Panel: Average Request Duration

Title: "Average HTTP Client Request Duration"
Visualization: Gauge or Line Graph
PromQL: sum(http_client_duration_milliseconds_sum) / sum(http_client_duration_milliseconds_count)
Panel: Request Duration Distribution

Title: "HTTP Client Request Duration Distribution"
Visualization: Heatmap or Bar Chart
PromQL:
promql
Copy code
http_client_duration_milliseconds_bucket
Panel: 99th Percentile Duration

Title: "99th Percentile HTTP Client Request Duration"
Visualization: Line Graph
PromQL:
promql
Copy code
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum(rate(http_client_duration_milliseconds_bucket[5m])) by (le))
Step 5: Review and Iterate
Regularly review the dashboard to ensure it provides the necessary insights.
Adjust and refine the visualizations based on feedback and evolving requirements.
Add alerts based on specific thresholds to get notified of performance issues.
By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive dashboard that provides valuable insights into the performance and behavior of your HTTP client requests.
