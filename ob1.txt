Observability is crucial for our application. We are transitioning from a Splunk-based full-stack solution to adopting Obstack for metrics and Observe for logging. The adapter is built on a microservices architecture, making strong observability even more essential for providing visibility into the API, which in turn improves operational efficiency. Since the adapter is a Node.js-based application without an out-of-the-box solution, the team, with support from the SRE team, developed a custom logger to successfully ship logs to Observe. Additionally, based on the metrics dashboard provided by the SRE team, we set up our own metrics dashboard in Obstack.
