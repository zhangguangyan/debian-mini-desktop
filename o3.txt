Logs: Logs are detailed, time-stamped records of events and messages generated by applications, services, or systems. They provide insight into what happened at specific points in time, including errors, warnings, and informational messages. Logs are useful for debugging and understanding the sequence of events leading to an issue.

Traces: Traces represent the end-to-end journey of a request or transaction as it flows through various services and components of a system. They help to visualize and analyze how different parts of the system interact with each other, identifying bottlenecks, latencies, and failures in the request path. Distributed tracing tools capture and track these traces across multiple services.

Metrics: Metrics are quantitative measurements that provide insights into the performance and health of systems over time. They include data points like response times, error rates, and resource utilization. Metrics are typically collected at regular intervals and used to monitor trends, set alerts, and assess system performance against defined thresholds.

Together, these pillars help in gaining a comprehensive understanding of system behavior, diagnosing issues, and maintaining overall system health.
